When you make a purchase or prior to making a purchase, a customer will get a message to review(share his/her opinion) on the favorite dish
on the dApp.
(This can be done after having a taste of the meal if  one is not a regular customer). There will be a link to direct the client to the FOOFASH platform.

As a reward for reviewing, the user will get the opportunity to mint NFT after connecting to their metamask account.

The goal is to give back to the community as much as we can while we grow the brand to become the first on food niche on the continent.

Also, we aim to publicize the use of crypto and get mass adoption of the currency together with the web3/blockchain technology.














               The smart contract for the social media platform is deployed on Polyon (Matic) Mumbai Test Network
